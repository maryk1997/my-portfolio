  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am currently <strong>studying Manual QA</strong>, learning how to design test cases, 
    report bugs, and ensure software quality. At the same time, I discovered my passion 
    for creative development — I recently built an <strong>advertising project with an 
    animated banner</strong>, and I really enjoyed the process of making something both 
    functional and visually engaging. 
  </p>
  <p>
    My goal is to combine my detail-oriented QA mindset with my creativity in frontend 
    development and animations, building projects that are reliable and delightful to use.
